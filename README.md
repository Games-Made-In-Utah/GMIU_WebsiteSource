# IGDA Games Made in Utah Website

## Overview

This project is the IGDA Games Made in Utah website, built with ASP.NET Core MVC and deployed on Netlify. It features community-driven content about indie games developed in Utah and provides users with event information and resources for local game developers.

## Features

- **Event Scraping**: Automatically fetches and displays upcoming events from IGDA.
- **Responsive Design**: Optimized for both desktop and mobile devices.
- **Custom Styles**: Includes custom styling using a color palette, animations, and hover effects.

## Requirements

- .NET SDK (6.0 LTS or later)
- Visual Studio or VSCode (with C# support)
- Node.js (if any frontend dependencies are needed)
- A Netlify account for deployment

## Folder Structure

Ensure the following files and folders are included in the output folder before deploying:

- **Views/Converted HTML**: Make sure all `.cshtml` views are converted to `.html` files. 
- **Static Assets**: Include `wwwroot/` for all static assets such as images, CSS, and JavaScript files.
- **Events Scraper Code**: The backend scraping functionality should be included as well.
- **Site CSS**: Ensure the custom `site.css` is updated based on the new color palette and layout modifications.

## Setup Instructions

### Step 1: Clone the Repository

1. Clone the project repository from GitHub:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/YourUsername/IGDA-Games-Made-In-Utah.git
   cd IGDA-Games-Made-In-Utah
   ```

### Step 2: Configure the Project

1. Ensure your `EventsController.cs`, `HomeController.cs`, and `EventScraper` logic are correctly implemented. Follow the structure weâ€™ve defined earlier.
2. Add all converted views to the `Views` folder, making sure they are `.html` files instead of `.cshtml`.
3. If you haven't already, include the `wwwroot/` directory for any static files (CSS, JS, Images).

### Step 3: Build the Project Locally

1. If you're running the ASP.NET Core project locally, build it using the following:

   ```bash
   dotnet build
   dotnet run
   ```

### Step 4: Prepare for Deployment to Netlify

1. **Ensure All Files Are in the Output Folder**: The following need to be present in the output folder:
   - All `.html` files converted from `.cshtml`.
   - `wwwroot` for all static assets (CSS, images, etc.).
   - Necessary configurations for the site.

2. **Add a `_redirects` File (Optional)**: If your project uses routing and you need to handle any redirects, create a `_redirects` file and place it in the root of your output folder.

### Step 5: Deploy to Netlify from Visual Studio Terminal

1. Open the Visual Studio terminal and ensure you are in the root directory of the project.
2. Install the Netlify CLI globally if you haven't already:

   ```bash
   npm install netlify-cli -g
   ```

3. Authenticate with Netlify by running:

   ```bash
   netlify login
   ```

4. **Create a Netlify Function** (if required):

   ```bash
   netlify functions:create
   ```

5. Deploy the site to Netlify:

   ```bash
   netlify deploy
   ```

   You will be prompted for the following:
   - **Deploy path**: Point to the output folder that contains your `.html` files and `wwwroot` directory.
   - **Production URL**: Verify the site with a provided Netlify draft URL, then deploy to production:

   ```bash
   netlify deploy --prod
   ```

### Step 6: Verify Deployment

Once deployed, navigate to your Netlify URL (which will be provided during deployment) to verify that the website is functioning correctly, including:

- Proper rendering of events.
- Fully responsive navigation and design.
- Links working as expected.

### Optional Step: Add Custom Domain

1. In your Netlify dashboard, go to **Domain settings**.
2. Add a custom domain if you have one and follow the DNS instructions provided.
